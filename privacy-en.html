        <p class="meta"><strong>EnglishFit — AI-Powered Language Practice Application</strong><br>Last Updated: February 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter "Policy") describes how EnglishFit (hereinafter "Application", "App", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when You (hereinafter "User", "You", or "Your") download, install, access, or use the Application.</p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting Your privacy. EnglishFit is designed as an <strong>offline-first application with optional cloud synchronization</strong> — Your data is stored primarily on Your device, and if You choose to create an account, it may also be synchronized to secure cloud storage. This Policy explains what information the Application accesses, how it is used, and Your rights regarding that information.</p>
        <p>By using the Application, You acknowledge that You have read and understood this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        </div>

        <h3>2.2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>

        <p>4.3. Data stored locally is protected by Your device's operating system security model, including application sandboxing. Access to Application data is restricted to the Application itself and is not shared with other applications.</p>
        <p>4.4. Authentication data (email and encrypted password or Google credentials) is managed by Firebase Authentication, a secure identity management service provided by Google. Passwords are never stored in plain text.</p>
        <p>4.5. We recommend that Users maintain standard device security practices, including screen lock, device encryption, and keeping the operating system up to date, to protect locally stored data.</p>
        <p>4.6. The Developer has access to cloud-stored data of registered users for the purpose of service maintenance and technical support. The Developer does not have access to data stored locally on Your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Camera and Photo Access</h2>
        <p>5.1. The Application requests access to Your device camera and/or photo gallery <strong>only</strong> for the purpose of allowing You to set a profile avatar photo.</p>
        <p>5.2. Camera and gallery access is:</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <p>(a) <strong>Optional</strong> — the Application functions fully without granting this permission;</p>
            <p>(b) <strong>User-initiated</strong> — access is requested only when You choose to set or change Your avatar photo;</p>
            <p>(c) <strong>Local-only</strong> — the selected or captured photo is stored exclusively on Your device within the Application's local storage and is never uploaded, transmitted, or shared with any external service or server.</p>
        </div>
        <p>5.3. You may revoke camera or gallery permissions at any time through Your device's system settings without affecting other Application functionality.</p>

        <h2>6. Text-to-Speech</h2>
        <p>6.1. The Application uses the device's built-in text-to-speech (TTS) engine to provide audio pronunciation of phrases and vocabulary.</p>
        <p>6.2. Text-to-speech processing is performed <strong>entirely on Your device</strong> using the system's native TTS service. No text or audio data is transmitted to external servers by the Application for this purpose.</p>
        <p>6.3. The availability and quality of TTS functionality depends on the TTS engines and language packs installed on Your device.</p>
